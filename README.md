# Practices for Linux vulnerability
This GitHub repository contains several security-related mini projects.

## 1. Buffer Overflow
Using GDB to identify the return address of a function, then exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability to overwrite the return address and gain control of the program's execution flow.
```
cd 1-buffer-overflow
make
./test
```

## 2. Brute force hash
A multi-threaded program that brute-forces a given SHA256 hash. The program uses multiple threads to speed up the computation and increase the chances of finding the correct hash.
```
cd 2-crack-hash
make
./crack-hash <threads> <passwordlength> <SHA256>
```

## 3. Privilege escalation backdoor
A backdoor for future unpriviledged users using the vulnerability that dynamic linker will search for shared libraries in the directories specified by the RPATH directive, even if those directories are not secure or trusted locations.
```
cd 3-privilege-escalation-backdoor
make
cp libexploit.so /tmp/lib
sudo chown root:root ./greeting
sudo chmod u+s ./greeting
```
(change to an unpriviledged account of current host)
```
cd 3-privilege-escalation-backdoor
./greeting
whoami
```

## 4. Rootkit
An attack program that will load a malicious kernel module, or rootkit, to conceal the presence of the attack program and its malicious activities. The rootkit is designed to be difficult to detect and remove, making it a powerful tool for attackers.
```
cd 4-rootkit
make
sudo ./sneaky_process
```
(The sneaky_process will run continuously until receiving a 'q' from stdin. Please open a new terminal to check the presence of it.)
```
cd 4-rootkit
ls
lsmod
```
(the sneaky_process will be hidden, you cannot find it by either program name or PID. And there is also no suspicious kernel module)
